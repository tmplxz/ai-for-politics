Wahrscheinlich werden sie die die drei Bilder mit KI Systemen bei gleicher Fragestellung erzeugt haben oder die Frage war leicht unterschiedlich. Deshalb gehört der Prompt immer zum Bild und auch das System, das diese Bild erzeugt hat. (z-B. Copilot oder Gemini etc.). Copilot bietet mir mittlerweile personalisierte Antworten auf meine Anfragen an und ich werde skeptisch. Ich suche eine objektive Antwort, nicht eine, welche meiner Einstellung entspricht. Die größte Gefahr jedoch besteht darin, das im politischen Bereich russische Desinformation, also Lügen, im Internet verbreiten und KI Systeme diese als Wahrheit aufnehmen. Es wird der Zeitpunkt kommen, wo im politischen Bereich die Lüge überwiegen wird. Außerdem habe ich gelernt, das KI Systeme in ihrer Trainingsphase nach einem Belohnungssystem trainiert werden. Diese Belohnungssysteme basiert auf menschlichen Einstellungen. Deshalb müssen mit amerikanischen Menschen trainierte KI Systeme nicht unbedingt europäischen Ansichten widerspiegeln und die MAGA Bewegung hat ein leichtes Spiel, ihre Positionen schleichend über KI generierte Inhalte in europäischen Köpfen zu implementieren, ohne das es die Europäer merken. Das ist die eigentliche Gefahr hinter der US Sicherheitsstrategie und ich schlage ihnen vor, das irgendwie in ihrer Studie zu beleuchten. Wenn sie möchten, kann ich ihnen gerne die Fachbegriffe bzw. Abstufungen des Trainings generativer KI nennen. Schade ist, das sie die Rolle des Menschen als Letztentscheiders in ihrer Umfrage nicht erwähnen und dort spielen Bildung und Fachkenntnisse eine enorme Rolle.$1866.19$134.91$179.07$150.53$1401.68$71MUlI67a

Durch die gezeigten Use-Cases können Barrieren zur politischen Telnahme abgebaut werden. Herausforderung ist eher, dass die ethische Verwendung von GenAI praktisch aktuell auf Freiwilligkeit beruht und es schwierig ist die Verwendung von GenAI einzufangen. Durch Agentic AI kann unkompliziert politische Meinungsmache betrieben werden. Grade die Verwendung von Botnetzwerken in Social Media oder durch die Content-Erstellung zu populistischen Zwecken (Musik, Videoinhalte). Inhalte können gezielt die Ängste der Menschen angreifen, ohne dass gezeigte Inhalte der Realität entsprechen müssen (Beispielprompt: Flüchtlinge überschwemmen das Land) . Menschen wollen psychologisch ihre Meinung als Realität ansehen. GenAI liefert unlimitiert Beweise dazu. Mit weiteren Fortschritten in der Videogenerierung wird es herausfordernd werden Videos grundlegend als Beweismittel zu verwenden.

Sofern wir hier diejenigen, die „Macht“ besitzen, nicht stoppen, wird die KI nur noch für persönliche Zwecke misbraucht werden. Dabei spielt es grundsätzlich keine Rolle mehr, ob die Technik ausschließlich für politische Manipulation verwendet wird. Grundsätzlich beführworte ich den Einsatz durch KI, in allen Bereichen, sie sorgt dafür, dass die Menschen ein Werkzeug erhalten, welches den Alltag erleichtert. Sie sollte aber in Maßen genossen werden. Sonst wird es so sein, wie bei NVIDIA, die inzwischen für Palpatine arbeiten. Zudem wird es immer schwieriger extremistische Züge (ja, ist noch sehr gelinde ausgedrückt) und manipiulierende Aussagen von der Realität zu unterscheiden. Auf TikTok gibt es immer wieder Reels, die rechts populistische Aussagen „verstecken“ und dadurch eine breitere Masse an Menschen erreichen. Wie mit allen anderen großartigen Erfindungen, sollte man auch hier seinen eigenen (hoffentlich gesunden) Menschenverstand einsetzen und so viel hinterfragen wie es nur irgendwie geht. Da die meisten bereits mit KI umgehen, werden sie auch die Schwächen bereits erkannt haben, denn die KI ist einfach nciht perfekt und zu einem großen Teil halluziniert sie sich einen zurecht.$1090.22$63.24$105.97$107.25$813.76$42FNeM44d
